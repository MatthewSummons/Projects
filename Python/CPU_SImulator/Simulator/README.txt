The directories Part I and Part II contain the solutions to their respective questions.
In each directory is a jpg of the Assembly code of the prog, a file with no extension containing the
machine code (in hex) for simulator and a python file which abstracts the function of the code. 

In the a2prog directory is the Question paper pdf, the code for the simulator that has been ammended
and the pdf file for submission.
