The current type checker does not support recursive function calls. The issue lies within
`checkFunEnv` and not `tcheck` [see rec.txt]. In fact if one were able to determine the return type
of a recursive function then tcheck can easily verify the result.

A possible fix to this would be to have the programmer explicitly write the return type
for (recursive) functions. Then we can check the body of the function call under the 
intended return type (along with the parameters and TFunEnv containing the types of
previously defined functions--now appended with the intended return type of the function
being type checked).
