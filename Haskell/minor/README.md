# Minor Projects

This directory contains various minor Haskell projects and exercises that I have worked on. These projects are small in scope and are intended to demonstrate specific concepts or techniques in Haskell. Each subdirectory contains a specific project or exercise, along with its source code and documentation.

## Add
Add arbitrarily large numbers using Haskell. This project demonstrates how to represent and manipulate large numbers in Haskell, using lists to store the digits of the numbers.

## DFA
A simple implementation of a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) in Haskell. This project demonstrates how to represent and simulate a DFA, which is a theoretical model of computation used in computer science.

## Hanoi
A solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem using Haskell. This project demonstrates how to solve the problem recursively, using Haskell's powerful pattern matching feautres and its support for ADTs.

## Interleave
A simple program that interleaves two lists in Haskell. This project demonstrates how to manipulate lists in Haskell, using recursion and pattern matching to combine the elements of the two lists.

## Tree
Work with binary trees in Haskell. This project demonstrates how to represent and manipulate binary trees, using algebraic data types and recursion. It includes functions for converting lists to binary search tress, checking if a tree is complete, & computing the min/max elements of a tree.

## MoreTree
Additional exercises and projects related to binary trees in Haskell. This project builds on the previous `tree` project, adding more complex operations and algorithms for working with binary trees. It includes functions for folding trees in pre-order, in-order, and post-order, as well as functions for computing the height of a tree and checking if a tree is balanced.

## Parse
A simple parser combinator library in Haskell. This project demonstrates how to build a parser using combinators, which are higher-order functions that combine simpler parsers to create more complex ones. It includes functions for parsing simple expressions and arithmetic operations.

## RList
A simple implementation of Random Access Lists in Haskell. This project demonstrates how to represent and manipulate random access lists, which are a data structure that allows for efficient access to elements at arbitrary positions. It includes functions for creating and manipulating random access lists, as well as functions for converting between random access lists and regular lists.

## TranspositionCipher
A simple implementation of a transposition cipher in Haskell. This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt messages using a transposition cipher, which is a method of encryption that rearranges the letters of the plaintext to create the ciphertext. It includes functions for encrypting and decrypting messages, as well as functions for generating keys and handling padding.
