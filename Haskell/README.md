# Haskell Projects

This directory contains various Haskell projects and exercises that I have worked on. Each subdirectory contains a specific project or exercise, along with its source code and documentation.

## interpretters
A collection of scripts and projects to study implementations of interpretters, type checkers and compilers. The projects are implemented in Haskell and cover various topics in programming languages, such as parsing, type checking, and code generation. See directory [interpretters](interpretters) for the source code and documentation.

## lectures
A collection of lectures and exercises on Functional Programming in Haskell. 

Lecture slides from Functional Programming [COMP3258]. This course is an elective offered at The University of Hong Kong and is taught by [Dr Oliveira Bruno](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/bruno). 

The lectures cover various topics in Haskell, including basic syntax, functional programming concepts, monads, functional parsing & correctness proofs. See directory [lectures](lectures) for the slides and exercises.

## minivi
A minimalistic Vim-like text editor written in Haskell. A fully functional text editor that supports basic text editing operations, such as inserting, deleting, and navigating text. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, while also being extensible and customizable. See directory [minivi](minivi) for a demostrtation and the source code.

## minor

A collection of minor Haskell projects and exercises that I have worked on. These projects are small in scope and are intended to demonstrate specific concepts or techniques in Haskell. See directory [minor](minor) for the source code and documentation.
