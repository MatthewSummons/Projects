Prologue:


Once upon a time, there was a little gitl. Her name was Hera. 
She lived with her father, her step-mother and her sister in a small village called Snowland. 
She also had a loyal husky friend named Lucky that her father has gifted to her. 
One day, the girl's father died of unknown ilness. He was the most important person for her and she loved him with all her heart.
The girl mourned day and night for her father. Suddenly, out of the darkness emerged a creature that called itself the spirit of Frost namely Moroz. 
The Spirit of Frost appears to all the dead. He looked at the girl appearing to be in deep thoughts.
Soon the spirit spoke up:


* Do you want to bring you father back to life?
* Yes. But why are you asking me that? It's impossible.
* Girl, what if I said that it is possible? 
  But everything comes with a price. I will tell you the way. You need magic crystals that will revive your father. 
  Parts of these crystals are held by evil Baba Yaga, Koshchei the Immortal, Zmey Gorynych and the Snow Queen. 
  If you manage to collect these crystals, you can make a magic flower by combing them. 
  This flower is very unusual, as it contains the magical power of all its current owners. 
  The one who take a posession of this flower can translate all their conceivable and inconceivable desires into reality. 
  This will be more than enough to revive your father.
  I am kind, so I will help you take possession of these crystals.


Choice:
- Agree:

  *The plot continues*


- Disagree:

  You seemed to be a sensible child until now. You disappointed me. 
  Since you foolishly declined my generous offer, so I will kill you. Useless girl.


Act 1: Baba Yaga.


As promised, the spirit accompanied the girl to the land of Baba Yaga and disappead once reaching the destination.
Hera saw an old wooden hut before her eyes. Curiosity took over her and she opened the creaky door.


An old woman was found to be sweeping the wooden floor with the broom made out of silver birch and mortar.
Seeing the girl, Baba Yaga was delighted and thought to herself, “He he. Today I will not be left hungry.” 
So she began to prepare the ingredients for her upcoming dinner. Time cannot be wasted.
She kindled a fire, put water in the cauldron, and spoke to the girl:


* Come in, girl, why are you standing halfway there. You must be hungry. I have some food waiting for you.
  Why don't you have a taste?


Choice:
- Come in to Baba Yaga's hut:

* Would it be really okay? I don't want to inconvenience the person I first met.
* You are asking? Come here and can call me grandma.
* Thank you, grandma.

When the girl approached Baba Yaga, pointed to the dusty stove next to her:

* For your hunger, there's a baked potato in the oven. Take it.

When the girl was about to reach to the inside of the stove, Hera understood Baba Yaga's true intention of cook her alive by trying to close the lid of the stove. 
In an urgent situation girl started thinking of the way to get out and decided to go for the trick:

* I can't reach the cauldron with potatoes. You have long arms, grandma, help me get it.
  Then Baba Yaga decided to look into the stove. 
  At that moment, the girl pushed Baba Yaga into the stove with a kindled fire and closed the lid of the stove. 
  Baba Yaga began to scream for help. Then the girl said:


* I'll help you if you give me your precious crystal. I don't think that it is more precious than your life. Think quick.


Baba Yaga had no choice but agree to give her crystal.

The girl came into Koshchei's castle. Koschei sitting in his bone throne has long seen her and finally said:


* You deserve a punishment for barging into my territory without my permission, little girl. 
  But I am merciful and fair ruler, therefore I will give you a choice, so that you choose your fate yourself. 
  I haven't been using my magic in a while. It wouldn't be bad to train it on you by turning you into something.

  I want to understand how you do it. As my last wish, show me first doing it on yourself.
* You are causing me trouble, but I'm still a merciful king. I will fulfill your last wish. 

Koschei turns into a cat. Lucky grabs the cat and puts it in his mouth, and brings it to Hera.

First head:

* We're not going to let you live. You are our prisoner. We will burn you.

Second head:

* Weren't we going to trample her over with our weight? It's fun.

  Which one of you has sharper teeth, so my death will be quick and painless? Can each of you show me your teeth? 


Dragon bows his head down for a better look and the girl jumps on the neck.


A spirit appears and gives Hera a magic sword. She threatens the dragon:

* Who are you, where are you from, and what do you need in my kingdom?

The girl froze and spoke to her: 


* I'm Hera and this is my dog ​​Lucky, I'm from Snowland, my father died and I'm looking for a means to resurrect my father.
* You are a kind girl, but you disturbed my peace. And for that, you will die slowly. 
  But there is one thing: if you become my successor, I will forgive you and let you live and I will teach you my art to turn people into ice. 
  You will stay here forever. What do you choose?


Choice:
- Die slowly:

Hera became an ice statue.

(BAD ENDING)



- Become her daughter:

And then a spirit arose and said:

* With this torch, you can turn the entire kingdom of the Snow Queen into water.

Hera put the torch into inventory. She was going to turn the entire kingdom, along with the queen, into water. 

The queen spoke:

* Girl, you are kind. You won't kill me, I didn't do you any harm. 
  Perhaps you will leave me and my kingdom alone if I give you my magic crystal. 
  You are kind girl, and not evil.

(FOURTH CRYSTAL PIECE OBTAINED)



Arriving back to home, Hera tries to put the crystal pieces together. However, to no vail. 
Then the spirit appears and smiles slyly. 

* Well done girl, you were able to get what I could not get at the time. However, you don't know everything. 
  4 crystals are not enough to revive your father. I didn't tell you that I also have a crystal, which is the last component. 
  Without this stone, you won't be able to revive your father. Only the power of five stones will give you what you want.
  But I was not going to give you my crystal, and I will not give it. And without my crystal, 4 crystals are worthless. 
  Therefore, you have to give them to me.

Choice:
- Try to change the mind of the evil spirit:

* You deceived me, evil spirit. And I will not give you my crystals, which I have obtained.
* Then I will kill you and take them from you.
* Don't kill me and don't take my crystals from me. You are kind, helped me all the way through, and saved me from death.
* I had my agenda all along, and I helped you for a reason.  
  I will become the most powerful being on earth and rule the world forever.
* Why do you need this power if it does not give you human and earthly happiness? 
  Is this what happiness is? Rule the world and enslave the people. You don't even have friends. 

Spirit thought:

* Yes indeed. I never had friends and no one ever offered me. That's why I became evil.
* Let's be friends then.
* Are you serious?
* Yes.
* Then I'll help you revive your father. But you won't need the stones anymore, and I'm leaving them for myself. 
  I decided to abandon my goals to enslave the world and will help people.


Hera returns home with a magical flower. Putting the flower in her father's hand, she sees her father open his eyes.

(GOOD ENDING)

- Give up the crystals to the evil spirit:

The spirit kills the girl once obtaining what he wanted. With the power of the crystal flower, he became the most powerful being on earth.
He did many bad deeds and brought the people misery and destruction.
